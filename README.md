MoviesTracker will be a full-stack web application designed to enhance the functionalities of the original MoviesTracker--simple- project. By leveraging the power of the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js), this project aims to provide a robust and scalable solution for managing and organizing movie collections. The application will offer an intuitive user interface for movie enthusiasts to track, organize, and explore their favorite films.
